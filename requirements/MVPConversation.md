Design Proposal: AI Mentor & Sounding Board Platform (MELD)
Introduction
MELD is envisioned as an AI-driven mentor and sounding board that helps users make sense of their personal story and reach their goals. Unlike traditional productivity apps, this platform is a strategic thinking partner – a “compass, not a calendar.” It will primarily serve high-potential young women (20s to early 30s) who are navigating transitions in life and career. These users are ambitious and talented, but often feel fragmented or unsure of their direction. They have been failed by sterile goal trackers and superficial mentorship programs, and they crave a deeper, more meaningful form of guidance. Meld AIms to fulfill that need by providing a trusted guide that feels human, warm, and grounding. The focus is not on checking off tasks, but on sense-making – helping the user understand what truly matters to her and why. This proposal outlines the approach for building such an AI mentor, grounded in psychological research and user behavior insights, and presents a design for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers ~80% of the value with a simple, focused feature set.
Psychological Grounding: Narrative Identity & Meaning
At the core of MELD is Narrative Identity Theory, which posits that we define who we are by crafting a personal life story that links our past, present, and future into a coherent narrative
news.weinberg.northwestern.edu
. Psychologist Dan McAdams, who developed this theory, found that stories are a natural psychological resource – they give our lives a sense of continuity, purpose, and meaning by attaching the past to an imagined future
news.weinberg.northwestern.edu
. In practice, this means that encouraging users to articulate their life experiences as a narrative can foster greater self-understanding and direction. Research shows that how we narrate our experiences has real impact: for example, psychotherapy patients who shifted their personal stories to include more themes of growth and agency subsequently showed improved mental health outcomes – their “stories changed first; then, their symptoms abated”
news.weinberg.northwestern.edu
. In general, changing our stories can precede changes in our well-being
news.weinberg.northwestern.edu
. People who frame tough life events as challenges that led to growth tend to become more resilient, self-directed, and fulfilled in the long run
news.weinberg.northwestern.edu
. This evidence underpins MELD’s strategy: by helping users recount where they’ve been, clarify where they are now, and envision where they’re going, the platform grounds personal development in meaning rather than just milestones. Equally important is the role of listening in narrative construction. When someone shares their life story with a willing, attentive listener, it affirms their identity – “they feel they’re being authentic, that they’re being heard, and that this is who they really are.”
news.weinberg.northwestern.edu
 This insight drives MELD’s user experience: the AI should “listen” first and reflect the user’s story back to them, mirroring the dynamic of a supportive mentor who deeply hears one’s experiences. By rooting the platform in narrative psychology, we aim to create leaders with clarity and purpose – users who lead their lives (and careers) with an internal compass derived from their own story, rather than external expectations. This approach aligns with MELD’s mission of developing meaning-driven leadership and personal growth.
Understanding the User: Who She Is and Why She Comes
Target User: Our primary user persona is a high-potential woman in her mid-20s to early 30s. She is educated, ambitious, and has tasted some early career experience. Now she finds herself at a crossroads – perhaps considering a job change, moving to a new city, ending or beginning a relationship, or reevaluating her career path. This period often resembles a “quarter-life crisis,” a well-documented phase of intensified self-reflection and identity questioning that many young adults go through
newportinstitute.com
newportinstitute.com
. In fact, about 75% of people aged 25–33 report experiencing such a quarter-life crisis, marked by feelings of uncertainty, insecurity, and confusion about identity and direction
newportinstitute.com
. Our user likely feels lost or stuck, sensing that her life lacks clear purpose or alignment. Yet, she is not one to settle for aimless drifting – she is ready to do the inner work to find a new direction that genuinely resonates with her values. Pain Points with Existing Solutions: This user has likely tried conventional productivity and goal-setting apps, or generic mentorship programs, only to find them unsatisfying. A standard goal tracker might help her set targets or manage time, but it feels sterile – it doesn’t address the “Why?” behind her goals. Superficial mentorship or networking programs might offer advice, yet she often feels like a cog being optimized, rather than a person being understood. The result is that she feels unseen and uninspired: these tools focus on doing more, not on understanding what she should be doing or why it matters to her. Our user does not want just another task manager; she wants clarity and meaning. She longs for a guide that listens to her whole story and helps her see the big picture of her life, so she can move forward with purpose. Motivation to Use MELD: She comes to MELD seeking clarity, direction, and a sense of coherence in a fragmented world. Perhaps she’s thinking: “I know I have potential, but I can’t figure out how to align my career with what truly matters to me. I feel pulled in many directions. I wish I had someone (or something) to talk through my thoughts and help me make sense of it all.” She is drawn by the promise of a “space for sense-making” – a judgment-free zone to reflect on her experiences and dreams. Importantly, she’s looking for personal growth with depth: she wants to lead with meaning, not just achieve for the sake of achievement. MELD’s positioning as a “trusted guide – human, warm, and grounding” is critical here. The platform must make her feel seen, not assessed; guided, not judged. If the AI mentor can demonstrate understanding of her feelings and values, and help illuminate a path that feels right (not just looks good on paper), she will quickly perceive value and develop trust in the product.
Key Principles for Building Trust and Value
To truly serve as a mentor-like partner, the MELD platform needs to establish trust with the user and deliver clear value early on. Based on user behavior research and best practices in UX, we propose the following core principles:
Empathetic, Active Listening: The AI should “listen” far more than it talks, especially in the beginning. This means prompting the user with open-ended questions and allowing her to pour out her thoughts, then reflecting back what it heard. Research in narrative psychology underscores that feeling heard and understood is crucial for authenticity and trust
news.weinberg.northwestern.edu
. For example, if the user expresses frustration about her current job, the AI might respond: “It sounds like you’re feeling unfulfilled in your current role and yearn for work that aligns with your passion for helping others. Did I get that right?” Such reflective summaries show the user that the system truly pays attention. This mirrors how a human mentor or therapist builds rapport – by active listening and validation.
Warm, Human-Like Tone: Although the user knows intellectually that MELD is an AI, the tone of all interactions should be conversational, warm, and non-judgmental. We will design the AI’s language to be encouraging and personable – more like talking to a supportive coach than using a tool. For instance, instead of saying “Goal set: Increase networking by 50%,” it might say “How did it feel when you reached out to that old colleague? I’m really glad you took that step!” This humanized tone helps the user perceive the AI as a trusted guide. It’s important to note that trust can be influenced by anthropomorphic cues and consistency in personality; however, we will also be transparent that this is an AI companion (to avoid any deceit). The idea is a friendly mentor persona: calm, supportive, and insightful, never cold or bossy.
Psychological Safety (Confidential & Non-Judgmental): Users will only open up about their real fears and dreams if they feel completely safe. Thus, MELD must hold a safe and anonymous space for the user to express herself without fear of judgment
rocky.ai
. Concretely, this involves a few design choices:
Assuring the user of privacy and confidentiality (e.g., explaining that her journal entries and chats are private to her, secured, and not shared – adhering to strong privacy standards). Privacy is our value number one in this mentorship context, as Rocky.ai’s coaching platform also emphasizes
rocky.ai
.
Never criticizing or evaluating the user’s choices. The AI will never “score” the user or make disapproving remarks. Instead, it maintains an accepting tone. Even when offering suggestions, it does so gently (“Have you considered…”) rather than directive commands.
Highlighting strengths and growth. To build a positive space, the AI points out the user’s strengths or progress whenever possible (authentically). For example: “I notice you were very courageous in that situation – you took a stand for your values. That’s something to be proud of.” This kind of feedback boosts the user’s confidence and sense of being valued, reinforcing trust.
Transparency of Purpose: We will be clear about what the AI mentor can and cannot do. This honesty actually builds trust, as users appreciate knowing the boundaries. For instance, the AI might introduce itself with a message: “I’m an AI designed to help you reflect, find clarity, and define your path forward. I won’t give you orders or shallow productivity hacks. Instead, I’ll ask questions, share patterns I notice, and help you come to your own answers. And if I ever get something wrong, or you just want me to listen, let me know – I’m here for you.” By explicitly stating “I won’t tell you what to do” (just as Rocky.ai’s coaching bot avoids doing
rocky.ai
), we align with the mentor philosophy that the user has her own answers – the AI is just a catalyst to bring them out. Acknowledging the AI’s limitations (for example, it’s not a therapist for severe mental health issues, and it might occasionally misunderstand) further grounds expectations in reality, which can increase cognitive trust in the system.
Consistency & Reliability: Trust is also built by consistency over time. The platform should deliver a reliable experience across each interaction – meaning the AI’s personality remains steady (always supportive and calm), and it remembers context from previous conversations. For example, if last week the user talked about a conflict with her manager, and she comes back today, the AI should recall and say, “Last time we spoke, you were grappling with that situation at work. How are things on that front now?” Remembering these details (with user permission to store conversation history securely) shows the user that she doesn’t have to start over every time and that the AI genuinely “knows” her story. This consistency creates a sense of having an ongoing relationship, much like one would with a human mentor who knows one’s background. Research in UX shows that trust is a cumulative outcome of dependable experiences throughout the user journey
uxpajournal.org
 – every touchpoint should reinforce the feeling of being cared for and understood. Therefore, MELD’s design will ensure continuity from one session to the next, weaving a cohesive narrative of the user’s journey.
By adhering to these principles – empathetic listening, warmth, safety, transparency, and consistency – MELD will cultivate both emotional trust and utility value. The user will not only feel comfortable with the AI, but also quickly see the value in using it: she’ll gain insights about herself, feel less alone in her struggles, and start to clarify a path forward. In an MVP context, focusing on these fundamentals will get us “80% of the way there” in delivering a compelling user experience, even if the feature set is very simple.
MVP Feature Set for Maximum Impact
For the initial version of MELD, we propose a minimalistic feature set that centers on the core interaction: a guided conversation that helps the user construct and make sense of her narrative. We want to capture the most critical 20% of features that will deliver 80% of the value. Below are the key MVP features, along with how each drives user trust and value:
1. Guided Storytelling Chat: The primary interface is a chat-based conversation with the AI mentor. Upon first use, instead of throwing the user into a dashboard, MELD greets her in a friendly manner and asks an open question to set the stage. For example: “What brings you here today?” or “Is there a goal or change in your life you’ve been thinking about lately?” Depending on her answer, the AI then gently guides her through reflecting on her past, present, and future:
Past: The AI might ask questions like “Can you tell me about a challenge you overcame in the past that you’re proud of?” or “What experiences in your life have been most meaningful to you so far?” This encourages the user to retrieve formative stories that highlight her strengths, values, and learning moments.
Present: To assess her current narrative, the AI could ask “How do you feel about where you are in life right now?” or “What are some current challenges or questions that keep you up at night?” This helps externalize any feelings of being “lost” or conflicts she’s experiencing.
Future: The AI may then ask future-oriented, imaginative questions like “If you could envision your ideal life 5 years from now, what would it look like? What would you be doing, and why would it matter to you?” By articulating an imagined future, the user starts to identify her aspirations and core desires.
This guided storytelling flow is crucial: it taps into narrative identity building by linking past efforts, present context, and future goals into one conversation. It’s essentially a casual life story interview conducted by the AI, broken into chat-sized chunks so it doesn’t feel overwhelming. Throughout this chat, the AI’s tone remains that of a curious, supportive mentor – it listens more than it speaks, but it keeps the conversation going with thoughtful prompts. This feature delivers value by helping the user organize her thoughts and memories into a storyline. Even this act of narrating can bring relief and clarity, as it turns disjointed thoughts into a cohesive narrative thread.
2. Active Reflection & Summarization: As the user shares her story, the AI periodically summarizes and reflects back key points. This feature is akin to having a mirror that shows you not just what happened, but what it means. For example, after the user describes a significant event (say, quitting a previous job due to burnout), the AI might respond: “You mentioned you left your last job to protect your well-being. It sounds like maintaining balance and health is really important to you.” Such reflections serve two purposes: (a) Validation – the user feels heard accurately, which builds trust; and (b) Insight generation – by highlighting patterns or values that the user herself may not have articulated directly. The AI can point out emotions (“I can hear how passionate you were about that project”), values (“It seems creativity and freedom are themes in what you enjoyed”), and even contradictions if any (“On one hand you crave stability, but you also light up when talking about taking risks – interesting!”). This is grounded in coaching techniques: as research on coaching chatbots suggests, asking the right questions and reflecting back can help users gain self-awareness
rocky.ai
rocky.ai
. We expect the user to derive immediate value from these insights – these “lightbulb moments” make the experience rewarding. Technically, this feature can be implemented with NLP that extracts sentiment and key phrases, but even simple rule-based reflections in an MVP (e.g. picking up emotionally loaded words the user uses and inquiring about them) can be effective.
3. Identification of Narrative Themes: Once enough story content is shared, the AI can help the user identify overarching themes or patterns in her narrative. Drawing from Narrative Identity Theory, these themes might be agency, growth, connection, creativity, leadership, etc., which often emerge from life stories
news.weinberg.northwestern.edu
news.weinberg.northwestern.edu
. For example, if the user’s stories frequently involve her taking initiative and overcoming obstacles, the AI might say: “I notice a theme of resilience and agency in your experiences – when faced with challenges, you find a way to grow through them. Does that resonate with you?” Alternatively, if the user often mentions feeling happiest when collaborating or helping others, the AI could highlight a theme of community or mentorship. By naming these themes, the platform gives the user a language to describe her identity. This is powerful because it shifts her perspective from seeing isolated events to seeing a coherent narrative of who she is. Research by McAdams and others indicates that when people construct redemptive narratives (stories where difficulties led to positive outcomes) or identify core themes, it correlates with greater resilience and goal-directedness
news.weinberg.northwestern.edu
. Even in an MVP, a simple rules-based approach could catch repeated words or sentiments (e.g., the user mentions “learning” or “creating” multiple times – flag this as a theme). The AI might present 2–3 possible themes and ask the user which feel true to her, making it a collaborative meaning-making exercise.
4. Visioning and Goal Setting in Context: After the storytelling and reflection phase, the AI transitions to helping the user articulate a forward-looking personal vision and meaningful goals. However, unlike typical goal-setting which might start from a blank slate or generic templates, MELD uses the narrative insights gathered to inform this step. For instance, if the conversation revealed that “making a positive social impact” is a recurring element of her story (say she volunteered in the past and found it fulfilling), the AI might guide her to frame a goal around that value: “Earlier you mentioned how important making a positive impact is to you. Let’s think of ways your next career move could honor that. What’s one change or project you could pursue that aligns with that desire?” This ensures her goals are anchored in self-knowledge – effectively, the goals become the next chapter in her personal narrative, not an arbitrary objective. The AI can employ techniques from positive psychology and coaching to make the goals motivating and attainable: for example, using visualization (“Imagine a year from now, you’ve achieved this goal – what does your life look like?”) and breaking the goal into smaller steps if needed. The outcome of this feature is that the user defines 1-3 key goals or directions with clear “whys” attached. It could be a career pivot plan, a personal growth goal (like building confidence in leadership), or even an exploratory goal (such as deciding to try a new field for a few months). What’s important is the user feels this goal truly matters to her story – thus she’s more likely to be intrinsically motivated to pursue it, rather than feeling it’s just another task.
5. Ongoing Mentorship & Check-Ins: To sustain trust and provide value beyond the first insightful session, MELD will include simple ongoing support features. An MVP approach here might be lightweight – for example, a weekly check-in message from the AI that asks about progress or changes since the last conversation. The tone remains that of a caring mentor: “Hey! Last time we talked, you were considering signing up for that design course (as part of your goal to pursue creativity). Just checking in – have you had any new thoughts on that, or any progress? I’m here if you want to chat about how it’s going.” These check-ins serve multiple purposes: (a) Accountability: They gently nudge the user to act on her own intentions (knowing someone/something will ask is a motivator, yet it doesn’t feel like pressure because the AI is non-judgmental). The Rocky.ai coach bot similarly emphasizes following up on previous chats to hold users accountable to positive habits and goals
rocky.ai
. (b) Continuity: By referencing the user’s earlier plans or concerns, it shows the AI remembers her story, reinforcing trust through consistency. (c) Adaptability: Life is not static; the AI can invite the user to reflect on any new developments. Maybe her situation changed – these check-ins give an opportunity to update the narrative and possibly recalibrate goals if needed. Over time, this ongoing dialogue can feel like having a mentor “in your corner” at all times. Even if the user doesn’t always respond, just receiving a question that prompts reflection can be valuable (she might reflect privately). The system could allow her to snooze or adjust the frequency of these prompts to ensure it’s helpful, not annoying. In the future, we could expand this to AI-driven content like inspirational articles or tailored tips (much like Rocky provides tailored tips and articles
rocky.ai
), but for MVP, simple personalized messages are sufficient.
6. (Optional) Journal and Story Archive: As a supporting feature, MELD could include a personal journal or “Story Archive” where important moments from chats are saved for the user to review. For example, after a deep chat, the AI might generate a short “story summary” — a narrative paragraph that encapsulates what the user shared (key events, themes, and her stated goals). The user can edit or add to this if she likes, essentially creating a living document of her narrative. This gives the user something tangible: a written story of her journey that she can revisit, which reinforces her identity development. Journaling itself is known to improve clarity and emotional well-being
positivepsychology.com
, so giving her a space to write freely (with the option of AI feedback or prompts on those entries) can further enhance the sense-making process. For MVP, this could be as simple as a text area labeled “Reflection Journal” that she can use anytime, and the AI can read those entries to tailor its mentoring (with permission). Over time, the “Story Archive” becomes a treasure trove of personal insights – when she’s feeling doubtful, she can read back over how far she’s come, which is empowering.
All these features are deliberately focused on conversation and reflection. The MVP avoids extraneous frills (no complex dashboards, no gamified streak counters – as those could shift the tone to productivity tracking, which we want to avoid). The interface would be clean and calming, perhaps with a simple chat screen and minimal UI chrome, so that the user can really immerse in the dialogue like she would in a journal or with a mentor over coffee. By concentrating on the storytelling and feedback loop, we capture the essence of MELD’s value: helping the user map complexity, find direction, and take action anchored in self-knowledge.
Example User Story: From Fragmented to Focused
To illustrate how a user might experience MELD, let’s walk through a sample journey with our persona “Alex”:
Onboarding & Trust Building: Alex, a 27-year-old professional, feels burned out and dissatisfied in her current job. She signs up for MELD after hearing it’s like having a personal mentor in your phone. When she first opens the app, she’s greeted warmly: “Hi Alex, I’m glad you’re here. What’s on your mind today?” Alex types a hesitant greeting and mentions, “I just feel stuck in my career and I’m not sure what to do next.” The AI responds empathetically, “I’m sorry to hear that – feeling stuck can be really stressful. This is a safe space to think out loud. Maybe we could start with what’s making you feel this way?” Relieved by the non-judgmental tone, Alex starts describing her situation. The AI listens intently (letting her write a few paragraphs), then reflects: “It sounds like you’re unfulfilled by your work in finance and you’re craving something more creative and meaningful. Did I get that right?” Alex sees that the AI understood her, which immediately makes her feel heard and seen
news.weinberg.northwestern.edu
. She confirms and continues the conversation, now more at ease.
Life Story Exploration: The AI gently shifts to her past to uncover clues about her passions. “Can I ask, was there a time in your life when you did feel you were doing something meaningful or exciting? Maybe a project or a hobby?” Alex thinks and then lights up, describing how in college she led a community arts program and loved it. As she types about this experience, she realizes how happy and alive she felt back then. The AI picks up on this: “I can hear the energy in your words when you talk about that arts program. What do you think made it so fulfilling for you?” Alex responds, “I guess I loved creating something that helped people...and working with others toward a positive goal.” She reflects that in her current job, she lacks that creative, people-centered aspect. The AI summarizes: “So creativity, community, and impact are really important to you, even if you didn’t realize it until now.” Alex pauses, feeling a click of clarity – yes, those are her core values. This realization — seeing a pattern from her own story — gives her a sense of direction (she thinks, maybe a career in social entrepreneurship or at least something with a creative team would suit her better).
Making Sense of the Present: Next, the AI asks about her present challenges in light of these values: “How do these things — creativity, community, impact — show up in your life right now?” Alex sighs and admits they’re missing in her current job; it’s all spreadsheets and solitary analysis. The AI responds with compassion: “No wonder you feel unfulfilled. It’s like a part of you has been dormant.” This validates Alex’s feelings (she’s not “crazy” for being unhappy in a prestigious job; there’s a real misalignment). The AI then reframes the “stuck” feeling as an opportunity: “The good news is, you’ve identified what’s lacking. That means we can figure out ways to bring those elements back into your life. Shall we brainstorm what’s next?” The tone is optimistic and empowering – Alex feels the first glimmer of hope and excitement about the future.
Envisioning the Future & Goal-Setting: Now the AI guides Alex to imagine possibilities. “Paint a picture for me: if you could design your ideal job or project, what would you be doing? Don’t worry about how to get there just yet – just describe it.” Alex describes a vision of running a small nonprofit that brings art to underserved communities, or at least having a creative role where she collaborates with others and helps society in some way. The AI acknowledges the passion in her description and then helps her refine this into a goal: “It sounds like making a positive impact through creativity is a key theme. Let’s turn that into something actionable. For example, one goal could be: ‘Transition to a career in the arts/nonprofit sector within 1 year.’ Or, if that feels too big right now, maybe: ‘Volunteer with a community arts program this quarter to explore that interest further.’ What feels right as a next step?” Alex, feeling inspired, decides her goal will be to make a career shift: she will start by volunteering on weekends (immediate step) and simultaneously research jobs or graduate programs in arts management (longer step). The AI helps her set a timeline (e.g., “This week, reach out to the director of the community art center I used to work with”). Because these actions tie back to a heartfelt narrative, Alex is motivated – this isn’t just a random goal, it’s a step towards the life that fits her story.
Wrapping Up & Looking Ahead: As the session winds down, the AI summarizes their discussion in an uplifting way: “We discovered that creativity, community, and impact are key to your story. You’ve set a goal to explore a career that honors those values, starting with volunteering at the art center. That’s an amazing step forward! I’m here to support you along the way.” Alex feels a sense of relief and excitement – in about 30-40 minutes of reflective chatting, she has gone from feeling lost to having a clearer direction and concrete next steps. Before she logs off, the AI adds: “Remember, your story is unfolding. It’s okay if things change, but never forget what matters to you. I’ll check in next week to see how it’s going and to talk through anything that comes up. You’re not alone in this.” This final assurance – that someone (even an AI) has her back and will follow up – leaves Alex feeling supported.
Follow-Up and Iteration: True to its word, a week later MELD pings Alex: “Hi Alex! How are you feeling this week? Did you get a chance to reach out to the art center?” Alex had indeed emailed the director and is scheduled to start volunteering. She happily shares this, and the AI congratulates her: “That’s wonderful! How do you feel about starting this weekend?” Alex admits she’s a bit nervous about balancing it with work, so the AI and she discuss time management and her excitement. Over the next few months, these periodic check-ins continue. When Alex hits obstacles (like a fear that she’s not qualified for nonprofit work), the AI helps her reframe negative thoughts and sometimes revisit her past stories for confidence (“Remember how you successfully raised funds for that college program – you have skills you can carry over”). If her goals need adjustment, they adjust together. Perhaps most importantly, if Alex feels discouraged, the AI is there to hold space for her feelings and then nudge her forward with her own narrative – “Every chapter has ups and downs. What matters is that you’re moving toward what feels meaningful. What have you learned about yourself in this chapter?” These conversations ensure Alex remains engaged and sees continuous value, as MELD evolves with her journey.
By the end of this user story, we see Alex has transformed her mindset: from fragmentation to a coherent vision. She trusts MELD because it consistently demonstrated empathy, remembered her story, and provided insightful guidance tailored to her. The value she gained is evident – she not only set and achieved tangible goals (like starting a volunteer position, applying to new jobs), but also developed a stronger sense of identity and purpose. In essence, Alex has become the protagonist of her own story again, with MELD as the wise guide by her side.
Conclusion
The design of the MELD platform centers on a simple truth: people find clarity and strength when they can narrate their life story and feel truly heard. By leveraging Narrative Identity Theory and proven coaching techniques, our AI mentor will help users make meaning out of their past and present, so they can chart a purposeful future. The proposal above outlines an MVP that is intentionally minimal – a warm chat interface with smart prompts, reflections, and follow-ups – because these are the features that drive 80% of the impact. This focus keeps the experience personal and intimate, avoiding the trap of feature-bloat that could dilute the human feel. In summary, MELD will feel less like an app and more like a relationship – one where the user is the author of her story and the AI is a trusted companion guiding her through self-discovery. This approach fosters resilience and self-direction (since the user bases her actions on a narrative she believes in
news.weinberg.northwestern.edu
), and it creates a deep, differentiated value compared to typical goal trackers. The combination of psychological grounding, empathetic design, and user-centered features is what will earn user trust. If we execute this well, our target users will finally have a tool that listens before it speaks, helping them understand what matters and why it matters in their lives – the foundation for any dream they choose to pursue. By building trust through authenticity and delivering value through insight, MELD can become the go-to compass for a generation of women seeking not just success, but meaningful success. It’s a humble beginning (just a chatbot in MVP form), but rooted in rich theory and user empathy, it has the potential to genuinely change lives – one personal story at a time.
